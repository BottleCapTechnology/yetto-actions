# Yetto Actions (for GitHub Actions)

To help you get the most out of your [Yetto](https://yettoapp.com) installation, we've created our own [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/features/actions)!

For detailed help, [check out our documentation](https://docs.yettoapp.com/incorporating-our-github-actions/).

## Usage

To get started, you'll need to:

1. Define a workflow file that uses `BottleCapTechnology/yetto-actions`.
2. Provide a configuration file with your own custom content for the text you'd like to use for the automation.

### Samples

We've provided [a sample workflow .yml and config .yml in the _samples_ directory](https://github.com/BottleCapTechnology/yetto-actions/tree/production/samples).
